# Data_Analysis_Titanic

###  Background
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

### Purpose

In this simple project,  we want to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive troungh different angles.


### About Dataset

The DataSet used is from ***Kaggle Titanic Challenge***:
 - [Downlaod Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
 -  Dataset name : train.scv


### About Dataset

> ***Data Dictionary***

| **Variable** | **Definition** |**Definition** |
|--|--|--|
|survival  |Survival  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes |
| pclass |Ticket class  | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd |
| sex|  Sex| |
| Age |  Age in years|  |
| sibsp | # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic |  |
| parch |  # of parents / children aboard the Titanic|  |
|ticket  | Ticket number |  |
|fare  |Passenger fare  |  |
| cabin | Cabin number |  |

> ***Variable Notes***
- pclass : A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)  
1st = Upper  
2nd = Middle  
3rd = Lower

- age : Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

- sibsp : How the dataset defines family relations :
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister  
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)

 - parch: How the dataset defines family relations: 
Parent = mother, father  
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson  
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
